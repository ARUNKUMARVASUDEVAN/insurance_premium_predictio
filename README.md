* code ` streamlit run app.py `

The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate the Insurance Premium of adults based on various demographic, educational, and occupational features. The model should analyze a given individual's characteristics and provide a prediction of insurance premium per year

## Requirements
This project requires Python 3.x and the following Python libraries installed:

NumPy
Pandas
matplotlib

Creating  A virtual Environment

         conda create -p venv python=3.8


## Result
After cleaning and preparing the data for the models, cross-validation has been done and other operations to compare between the models.

Finally, The Random Forest Regressor has been chosen, for achieving very high results in terms of evaluation metrics..
